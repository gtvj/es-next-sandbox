# ECMAScript sandbox

This repository is intended to act as an easily reproducible sandbox for exploring the newest features of ECMAScript.

## Development machine setup 

Easy. Simply clone and run `npm install` from project root, then run `npm start` to kick off the webpack development server and watch task. From this point on any changes to files within the dependency graph are being watched.
